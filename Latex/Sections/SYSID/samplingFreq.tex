A good choice of the sampling frequency is necessary to fully capture the system's output.
A rule of thump is to select the sampling frequency 
$$
\omega_S = 10\omega_B
$$
where $\omega_B$ is the bandwidth of the system. \\

\noindent The system bandwidth can be estimated by using the following relationship between the bandwidth and rise time of the system's step response.
$$
 T = \frac{2\pi}{10\omega_B}
$$
where T is the interval between about eight sampled points on the rise time which is approximately sampling at $10\omega_B$. $\omega_B$ can thus be estimated by rewriting the above relationship and substituting $T$. \\

\noindent The results for both heaters can be found in table \ref{Tab:stepInfo}.

 & Steady State ($^{\circ}C$) & Rise Time (s) & $\omega_B$ (rad/s) & $\omega_S$ (rad/s) \\ \cline{2-5} 
Heater 1 & 67.79 & 318 & 0.016 & 0.16 \\
Heater 2 & 57.04 & 357 & 0.014 & 0.14
