\subsubsection{Theoretical system model}
For system identification, it is useful to know the order of system. A theoretical model can be used a basis for obtaining the order. The dynamics of the two heaters can be described by \cite{APMonitor}
\begin{align}
    mc_p\dot{T}_1 &= U A (T_{\infty} - T_1) + \epsilon\sigma(T^4_{\infty} - T1^4_1) + Q_{C12} + Q_{R12} +\alpha_1 Q_1 \nonumber \\
    mc_p\dot{T}_2 &= U A (T_{\infty} - T_2) + \epsilon\sigma(T^4_{\infty} - T1^4_2) - Q_{C12} - Q_{R12} +\alpha_2 Q_2 \nonumber
\end{align}
The parameters can be found in table \ref{tab:theModelPara}. To obtain these equations, the following derivation can be used:
$$
    mc_p\dot{T} = \sum\dot{h}_{in} - \sum\dot{h}_{out} + Q
$$
where $\dot{h}$ represents the change in enthalpie. The energy leaving the system, $ \sum\dot{h}_{out}$, consist of the convective term  $U A (T_{\infty} - T)$ and the radiation term $\epsilon\sigma(T^4_{\infty} - T1^4_1)$ with the ambien envireonment. The incoming energy consist of the energiy flowing from the other heater, convective and radiation
\begin{align}
    Q_{C12} = U A_s (T_2 -T_1) \nonumber \\
    Q_{R12} = \epsilon\sigma(T^4_{2} - T1^4_1) \nonumber
\end{align}
Of course, the heat transfer from heater 1 to heater 2 is outgoing for heater 1, and incoming for heater 2. $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ represent the input heat, generated by the transistors. These inputs are scaled by a factor $\alpha$.
