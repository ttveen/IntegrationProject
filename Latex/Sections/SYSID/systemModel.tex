\subsection{Theoretical system model}\label{TSM}
For system identification, it is useful to know the order of system. A theoretical model can be used as basis for obtaining the order. The dynamics of the two heaters and temperature sensors can be described by \cite{APMonitor}
\begin{align}
    mc_p\dot{T}_{H1} &= U A (T_{\infty} - T_{H1}) + \epsilon\sigma A(T^4_{\infty} - T^4_{H1}) + Q_{C12} + Q_{R12} +\alpha_1 Q_1 \label{eq:nonlin1} \\
    mc_p\dot{T}_{H2} &= U A (T_{\infty} - T_{H2}) + \epsilon\sigma A(T^4_{\infty} - T^4_{H2}) - Q_{C12} - Q_{R12} +\alpha_2 Q_2 \label{eq:nonlin2}
\end{align}

The parameters can be found in table \ref{tab:theModelPara}. To obtain these equations, the following derivation can be used:
$$
    mc_p\dot{T} = \sum\dot{h}_{in} - \sum\dot{h}_{out} + Q
$$
where $\dot{h}$ represents the change in enthalpy. The energy leaving the system, $ \sum\dot{h}_{out}$, consist of the convective term  $U A (T_{\infty} - T)$ and the radiation term $\epsilon\sigma(T^4_{\infty} - T1^4_1)$ with the ambient environment. The incoming energy consist of the energy flowing from the other heater, convective and radiation
\begin{align}
    Q_{C12} &= U A_s (T_2 -T_1) \nonumber \\
    Q_{R12} &= \epsilon\sigma A (T^4_{2} - T1^4_1) \nonumber
\end{align}
Of course, the heat transfer from heater 1 to heater 2 is outgoing for heater 1, and incoming for heater 2. $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ represent the input heat, generated by the transistors. These inputs are scaled by a factor $\alpha$.

% The dynamics of the temperature sensors can be described by
The temperature sensors also have their own dynamics which can be described by
\begin{align}
    \tau \frac{d T_{C 1}}{d t} &= T_{H 1}-T_{C_{1}} \label{eq:nonlin3}\\ 
    \tau \frac{d T_{C 2}}{d t} &= T_{H 2}-T_{C_{2}} \label{eq:nonlin4}
\end{align}
where $\tau$ is the conduction time constant which is equal to 
$$
\tau = \frac{m_{s} c_{p, s} \Delta x}{k A_{c}}
$$
These differential equations are derived from the rate of heat flow equation below
$$
\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=-k A \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}
$$
where \\
$\Delta Q$, is the net heat transfer\\
$k$, is the thermal conductivity\\
$A$, is the surface area the heat emitting surface\\
$\Delta x$, is the thickness of the material conducting the heat.
