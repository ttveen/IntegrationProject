In this chapter the credibilty of the experiments, and the potiential for more research will be discussed.\\
All experiments were done in a room that is not climate controlled. As the ambient temperature is expected to be of significant importance to the system, this could have influenced the experiments. The same experiment performed at different times could give different results.\\
The identified models for both Linear Least Squares and MOESP are not tested with different data than they were fitted for. This gives a inaccurate representation of the performance, since overfitting on the data will lead to a lower RMS error, while the model is less accurate. The performance of the N4SID model with the Kalman filter was inspected with different data, so that given RMS error of that model is more reliable.\\
All the controllers in this report are not tuned extensively. The performance for both the pole-placement controller and LQR controller could likely be improved with parameter tuning. The performance of the MPC controller was mostly defined by the bounds on the input, so tuning of parameters would give less improvement of the controller.\\

For further research, it could be investigated what disturbances would do to the system. Additionally, using a subspace identified model as a basis for an error prediction method could improve the system model, as shown in \cite{1184569}.
