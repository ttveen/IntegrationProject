To check if the dynamical system is linear the following condition needs to apply
$$
f(t,x,au_a+bu_b) = af(t,x,u_a) + bf(t,x,u_b)
$$
By choosing the values 
$$
a = b = 1 \text{ and } u_a = u_b = 0.25
$$
Two different simulations are obtained
$$
f(t,x,0.5) = 2f(t,x,0.25)
$$
that need to be performed and compared to each other to check if the above linearity condition apply.
Figure \ref{fig:LinComp} shows the comparison between the two performed simulations
