\subsection{Model Predictive Control}
Model Predictive Control is a feedback control strategy that relies on minimising a cost function, for a finite horizon. MPC allows for bounds on the states, input and output. First, Linear Quadratic Control (LQR), will be considered. LQR relies on minimising a cost function, but for a infinite horizon. LQR does not allow for constraints.
