    abstract = "{The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using the Bode-Shannon representation of random processes and the “state-transition” method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.}",

abstract = "Recently a great deal of attention has been given to numerical algorithms for subspace state space system identification (N4SID). In this paper, we derive two new N4SID algorithms to identify mixed deterministic-stochastic systems. Both algorithms determine state sequences through the projection of input and output data. These state sequences are shown to be outputs of non-steady state Kalman filter banks. From these it is easy to determine the state space system matrices. The N4SID algorithms are always convergent (non-iterative) and numerically stable since they only make use of QR and Singular Value Decompositions. Both N4SID algorithms are similar, but the second one trades off accuracy for simplicity. These new algorithms are compared with existing subspace algorithms in theory and in practice."
