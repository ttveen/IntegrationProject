# To-Do

- [x] Calculate (Mean,relative,etc) error of the two models
- [x] Calculate (Mean,relative,etc) error of the two controllers
- [x] Make comparison figures of the two controllers (separate figure for Heater 1, Heater 2, input 1, input 2, disturbance rejection)
- [ ] Write figures etc with uppercase
- [x] Describe the symbols (symbol list)
- [x] Discussion
- [x] Conclusion
- [ ] Abstract
- [ ] Spellings-check (read the document)
- [ ] Reference track for the pole placement controller
- [x] Check if the LS RMSE is correct. The vectors might be transposed!
- [ ] Q,R and P matrices for MPC need to change (not the same as LQR)
- [ ] Finish MPC reference tracking 
- [ ] fix the placement of the figures
