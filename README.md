# Introduction Project
## /DATA

This directory contains all the experiment data and different identified models.

## /Latex

This directory contains the latex files, used with overleaf. In the Latex directory, there is a folder for all the images used, and some not used ones.  All images are .svg, so they allow for rescaling when zooming in. There is also a folder with all the .tex files.

## /Matlab files

This directory contains all the Matlab .m files. The folders correspond to different chapters of the report. In the /test folder, the files supplied by APMonitor are provided. In /UnusedMatlabScript are all the .m files that we did not use.
